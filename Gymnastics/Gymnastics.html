    <p>Gymnastics has been at every Summer Olympics since 1896. For 32 years, men were only<br> allowed to compete but in the 1928 Summer Olympics women were allowed to compete in<br> artistic gymnastics. This sport requires strength, flexibility, agility, coordination, endurance<br> and control. Rhythmic gymnastics was introduced in 1984 and trampoline events were added in<br> 2000. The nation with the highest number of medals in artistic gymnastics and rhythmic<br> gymnastics is Russia. In artistic, they have 72 gold, 67 silver and 43 bronze, with a total of<br> 182; in rhythmic, they have 10 gold, 4 silver and 2 bronze, with a total of 16 medals. The<br> United States is second in artistic gymnastics with a total number 114 medals. The gymnasts<br> are scored by the difficulty of the elements the gymnast attempts and whether they meet the<br> composition requirements, landing is also looked at. </p>
